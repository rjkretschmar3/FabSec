\section{Conclusion}
	\hspace{10mm}Though my work in the project, I believe that there is a case to be made to use Consortium Blockchain technology as a security network to work in tandem with an existing network in motion. The ability to take nodes on-and-off a network at will can do wonders for scalability. As well as Fabric's capacity to run multiple Blockchain segmented within Channels for a host of different Use Cases. So that each Use Case will have its own dedicated Ledger and set of processes within the User-Defined Chaincode. There is potential to take this technology forward and see how far it can actually provide support to the Next Generation of Wide Area Networks.

# This script will now register and enroll the administrator for the Organizational CA 
# Server. The Org CA, also known as the Fab CA, is the server in charge of creating the 
# identities that will be used in the actual Fabric network. That is, it names the 
# participants of the network and is used for the permissioning of the system. First, 
# however, it'll need its own administrator and, as with every node/participant on the 
# network, will need to be registered and enrolled on with the TLS server for secure 
# communications.
#
# As with the other scripts, the commandline arguments will be positional:
#	1) Whether it is an ~orderer~ or ~peer~ organization.
#	2) The ID number of the organization.
# 
# The default Org CA admin is going to have the credentials of 
# org<ID#>-fab-admin:org<ID#>-fab-admin-pw similar to that of the TLS admin. (In a true 
# production environment, I would modify the script to accept user input for these 
# values as defaults are a security hazard in and of themselves.)

# As usual, move to the ca-client directory of the appropriate org.

# Don't forget to set the environmental variable $FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME. As with the last 
# script, since we're already there, this is simple.
echo "export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$PWD"
export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=$PWD

# Next, register the Fab CA admin identity. For few notes here:
#	1) Registering an identity on the TLS (or any CA) server is done by the admin of 
# that server (in this case, the TLS server admin), and let's the server know that there 
# will be an enroll request coming in at some point in the future.
#	2) That enroll request, as we'll see later, comes from the actual user whose 
# credentials they belong to. In this case, the Fab CA admin. (This is a separation of 
# concerns/power thing.)
#	3) localhost is where the TLS server lives. If you host the server on a different 
# physical machine (or logical network partition), put it there. Same with the port.
#	4) The --mspdir flag here (that is, for the register command) points to the MSP 
# directory of the TLS admin, so that the TLS server knows this command was employed by 
# the true admin (in lieu of username/password).

# Dynamically grab the TLS admin username to access their MSP.

# to leave these around on a true production server.)

# Now, we enroll the Fab CA admin. Again, it's going to look similar to the enroll command
# in the previous script with the username and password being the ones we've just 
# registered, and the --mspdir NOW pointing to where we store the key and public cert of 
# the Fab CA admin for later use.

# Finally, once the key is generated, it's an ugly alphanumeric string ending in _sk. 
# Renaming it to something like key.pem would be good since it will be needed to deploy 
# the other CA (that is the Fab CA (remember this script only registers and enrolls the 
# Fab CA admin, it doesn't set up the actual Fab CA Server. That's coming next script.)

		With the rapidly expanding state of networks -- such as Metropolitan Area Networks -- in various locales, scalability is continually at the forefront of issues with which network engineers have to contend. One issue that seems to come up in particular is that of network security scalability. This project attempts to explore the use of Distributed Ledger Technology (also known as Blockchain Technology for Business), specifically that of The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric, to create an overlay security network with distributed information in the form of Ledgers and distributed processes in the form of programmable Chaincode (Smart Contracts). Here we will test the bounds of the effectiveness of this technology with regard to typical network security challenges, such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Prevention, Domain Name System Security (DNSSec), and beyond.

\section{Summary}
	\hspace{10mm}In this project, I created a Hyperledger Fabric network from the bottom up with the idea in mind of creating a dedicated security network to overlay an existing Wide Area Network or some sort. The network consists of three Organizations: two Peers and an Orderer. This is to reflect a real world network on which to deploy my chaincode for a Distributed Logging Aggregator. Of course, this is just an illustrative Use Case, and it is my hope to apply different security-focused Use Cases such as, but not limited to, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) prevention, Domain Name System Security (DNSSec), and others.

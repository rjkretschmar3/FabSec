# This script will initialize and deploy an Organization's TLS CA Server. It assumes a few
# things:
#	Commandline Arguments are positional and are as follows:
#		1) Whether it is an ~orderer~ or ~peer~ organization.
#		2) The ID number of the organization. (In the real world, this would be 
#		an actual name.)
#
# 	The directory infrastructure is already in place. For example, a peer organization
# of ID 1 would have the directory structure of 
# organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.fabsec.com, and specifically the directory 
# tls-ca-server under that tree. 
#
#	Furthermore, that the fabric-ca-server binary is located in the tls-ca-server 
# directory under org1.fabsec.com (or whichever organization you're working with).

# ADDED TO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN:
read -p "This script is for initializing a new TLS server.

# Next, this will initialize the server. Initialization does a few things: 
#	1) It will register a bootstrap identity, which will be in the form of 
# <ADMIN_USER>:<ADMIN_PW>. In the case of the above example the bootstrap identity will be
# org1-tls-admin:org1-tls-adminpw.
#	2) It'll set the default CA Home directory environmental variable FABRIC_CA_HOME 
# to the present working directory. (Thus, the need to traverse there in the previous 
# steps.)
#	3) Generates the default YAML configuration file. (Talked about later.)
#	4) Generates the TLS CA root signed certificate file ca-cert.pem
#	5) Generates the TLS CA server private key and stores it in the FABRIC_CA_HOME 
# directory under /msp/keystore

# Here is where it gets murky. As mentioned this initialization process generates a default
# YAML file for server configuration. I have yet to find an elegant way to automatically 
# change some of the default values to the working ones. For now, it opens up vim for 
# manual editing. (However, I can generate and present the values for the operator to write
# down before changing them.) TODO: Research the program 'yq' for this task.

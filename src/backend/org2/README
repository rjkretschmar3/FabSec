This is the JS script to the backend for Organization 2. There are no scripts in the package.json
file yet (although, it does have the required libraries defined), but it's rather easy to get up and running.

If node_modules doesn't exist:
npm install

Before anything:
node enroll-admin.js
node register-enroll-user.js

To launch the log monitor/committer:
node watch-and-commit-logs.js

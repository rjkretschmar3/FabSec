# This script will enroll the Fab CA admin with the Fab CA server. Remember that an enroll 
# command tells the server to generate and return the signed certificate and private key for 
# the actor you're enrolling. This key-pair for the admin identity will allow that admin to 
# enroll other identities.
#
# The directory tree assumed to be in place for this script is ca-client/fab-ca/ to store 
# the certificates that are issued by the enroll command against the Fab CA and 
# ca-client/tls-root-cert/ for the secure communications.

# First move to the appropriate directory.

# Now we can issue the enroll command.
# NOTE: One of the commandline arguments (not used here... yet) is that of --csr.hosts which 
# is followed by a comma-separated list of hostnames for which the certificate is valid. 
# Since I am currently doing development all on the same host "hypertest" is fine. However, 
# when I expand this to multiple virtual hosts (to simulate a real network), I'll have to 
# figure out the hostname management.

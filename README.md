These are the internals of my CPSC 597 Graduate Project. This is written, administered, and maintained by Robert Kretschmar. FabSec (short for Fabric Security) is a exploration in the potential of using Hyperledger Fabric's Distributed Ledger Technology as a dedicated security network. The hope is that this could even be applied to non-permissioned and/or public blockchains in future work.

The choice to start with using Fabric for this idea was the ability to start up multiple private blockchains for the different security tasks. The Proof-of-Concept will be a single blockchain to be used as a distributed log aggregator with no single point of failure. Logging nodes can be added and removed at will.

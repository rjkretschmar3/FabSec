# This script is the sibling script to 007-register-enroll-new-peer-node where we instead register
# and enroll a new orderer node. It will follow the same logic, as there is not much difference
# between the two actions other than (1) where the Local MSP will end up being generated, and (2)
# the "id.type" in the register command. As you could imagine, the latter is changed from "peer" to
# "orderer". So, for a more in-depth explanation to what these commands are doing, I refer you to
# that script's comments.

# Since the act of setting up an orderer is intrinsically happening within an Orderer Organization,
# the script will not need that information via commandline arguments. However, it will need to know
# specifically which Orderer Org we want to operate within, and which Orderer Node we want to operate
# on.

# So, let's make sure we have the correct number of arguments before moving on. If we do not,
# return a nice message to the user on how to use this script.

# Since we are using the organization's CA Client to fulfill these requests we should move

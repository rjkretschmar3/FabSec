# This script is another massive change in gears from the previous scripts. Now, we get to
# set up the peers of the network.. I won't go into a lot of detail as to what a Peer is in
# relation to the Fabric network as most of that information is in the README.md of this
# project. Suffice it to say, however, they are one of the two type of Nodes on the Fabric
# network, the other being Orderers, and they host the Chaincode and the Ledgers and allow
# users a way to interact with the Blockchain.

# When I say "sets up the peers", I mean this script interacts with the CA servers,
# specifically the Fab CA server, to collect the cryptographic material that defines this
# peer's identity. (Also the TLS server for the secure communication.) This identity will 
# be collected into an `msp` directory (MSP standing for Membership Service Provider) also 
# known as a "local MSP" since its the MSP for a node. (This is opposed to a Channel or Org
# MSP which is talked about in the Orderer scripts and section of the README.md) The MSP holds 
# the identifying information of the node. There will also be a special `tls-msp` to hold the
# TLS information of the node.

# This time we don't need to know whether or not the organization is a Orderer Org or Peer 
# Org since it's for a peer node meaning it is intrinsically for a Peer Organization.

# However, we do still need to know two things: The Organizational ID Number and the Peer ID 
# Number. These will be the first and second positional arguments, respectively.

# Let's make sure we have the correct number of arguments before moving on. If we do not,
# return a nice message to the user on how to use this script.

# EDIT: In an attempt to streamline this script, I'm adding a section where the port numbers of the TLS and
# Fab CA are chosen depending on which of the Peer Orgs the operator of this script is trying to operate
# within. This port are now part of my Design Decisions (talked about in the README) and are assign when
# setting up those servers. In the future, I will hope to make this more dynamic to allow from more than
# just the two "pre-programmed" Peer Orgs.

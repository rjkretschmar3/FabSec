# This script will initialize and deploy an Organization's Fabric CA Server. There is a 
# bit of linguistic confusion here as the official documentation calls this the Organization 
# CA Server, but I fear this overloads the word "Organization"... not that Fabric CA Server 
# is any better, but it is a bit less overloaded.
#
# That being said, the purpose of this Fab CA Server, as opposed to the TLS CA Server, is to 
# manage identities that will be used heavily on the whole of the network. It fills the 
# "permissioned" quality of the network. I'll explain more as we hit different responsibilities
# of this server. For now, let's initialize and deploy it.
#
# As with the other scripts, we have the commandline arguments being ~orderer~ or ~peer~ and 
# the ID number of the org in question.
#
# Also, like the TLS Deployment script (001), this script assumes the directory structure for
# the Fab Server of organizations/{orderer|peer}Organizations/org{ID#}.fabsec.com, and 
# specifically the fab-ca-server directory under that tree.

# First, as always, let's move to the correct working directory.

        echo "cd ../organizations/ordererOrganizations/org$2.fabsec.com/fab-ca-server";

elif [[ "$1" == "peer" ]]; then

read -p "This script is for initializing a new Fab CA server. If you have an existing Fab CA server, " \

# they identifies themselves to the TLS server (in lieu of credentials) and lives in 
# ca-client/tls-ca/<fab-admin>/msp/signedcerts/ directory. The key.pem, or what we ended up 
# renaming to key.pem, is the signing key for the admin and lives in a similar location to 
# above but msp/keystore/ directory. These will be conveniently place in a directory called tls/

=================================================

NOTE: Many of the conceptual details about the Hyperledger Fabric system that were in this README 
file were reproduced in my formal report. So, to keep from too much redundancy, and to keep this 
README manageable for casual observers of my project, I'll just have the functional details of my project 
in here.

=================================================

These are the internals (scripts, chaincode, and binaries) of my CPSC 597 Graduate Project. They were
written/modified, administered, and maintained by Robert Kretschmar. The latest official Read the Docs 
for Hyperledger Fabric (release-2.2 at the time of writing) were used for guiding the building of this 
project, so much thanks to those giants on whose shoulders I stand.

Blockchain technology has been a disruptive force in this world. Originally, that disruption was felt 
in the financial sector with Bitcoin. This relegation to the financial sector existed because the 
Bitcoin scripting language Script was intentionally non-Turing complete; perfect for its Use Case as a 
cryptocurrency, but otherwise significantly under-powered for general applications. However, it wasn't 
long until the next level came in the form of Ethereum which introduced a Turing-complete scripting 
language along side its cryptocurrency offering. This opened up the world to the possibility of 
decentralized applications (dApps). While those platforms were necessarily public and open, others still 
thought about other Use Cases that would benefit from the use of this type of distributed technology -- 
ledgers in the form of cryptographically connected blocks, decentralized node consensus, scripting to build 
applications on these platforms, etc. -- in a private and permissioned space. One of those offerings was a 
system, itself defined and built by a consortium of organizations (from Intel to IBM), maintained by The 
Linux Foundation called The Hyperledger Project.

FabSec (short for Fabric Security) is an exploration in the potential of using Hyperledger Fabric's 
Distributed Ledger Technology as a dedicated security network. Hyperledger is an ecosystem of different 
tools, libraries and frameworks for creating different types of Blockchains: from private and permissioned 
to public and permissionless. Fabric is one of those Blockchain frameworks. It allows multiple actors to 
share a blockchain between themselves for any Use Case which to they could think to apply it.

This project attempts to explore use of this technology in the security space, namely having a dedicated 
security network between actors. These actors can be two (or more) organizations looking to join forces 
and pool security resources. In fact, how this idea got started was thinking about having a dedicated 
security network as an overlay to something like a Wide-Area Network (WAN) specifically that of a 
Metropolitan-Area Network (MAN). (Or really any network system which is large enough the scaling security 
could present a problem.) You could have multiple organizations within a city each helping to strengthen 
the security mission of their networks without having that security centralized as a city is often its own 
ecosystem of businesses, departments, and other stakeholders. An extended hope is that this could one day 
be applied to non-permissioned and/or public blockchains in future work. 

*A note about terminology: You'll see a few terms being used here such as Consortium Blockchain and 
Distributed Ledger. For the purposes of this project, as well as many others these are interchangeable. This 
interchangeability holds because a Blockchain system at its base is nothing more than a Distributed Ledger of 
transactions. Another example of this seen later is Chaincode vs Smart Contracts.*

The choice to start with using Fabric for this idea was the ability to have full control of the blockchain 
in question while the structure was being planned out and the scripts and chaincode were being developed. A 
public blockchain such as Ethereum sounded like too many unknown variables right out-of-the-gate. That being 
said, and as mentioned above, it is a hope that once the plans are solidified translating this work to a 
public blockchain won't be too difficult. However, something thought about after this choice was made was 
doubling down on the idea of using a permissioned blockchain such as Fabric for a real implementation, such 
as for a MAN. The beauty of the idea is that its easily translatable to many different platforms. For security 
network applications, I believe this could have great value in the realms of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), 
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) prevention, Domain Name System Security 
(DNSSec), and beyond! The Proof-of-Concept of his research project will be a single blockchain network -- or 
Channel in Hyperledger parlance -- to be used as a distributed log aggregator. As anyone in blue team security 
can tell you, the logs are everything!

### Design Decisions

The following are the different Design Decisions I had to make throughout this project:	

* Currently, there will be three Organizations involved. Two Peers and and an Orderer. The Peer Organizations 
will be the participants that will use the security system. In the context of a Log Aggregator network, they 
will be the ones logging to the blockchain and retrieving data back from it. The Orderer Organization acts as 
the Consensus nodes. It will do the assembling of transactions into blocks, validates those blocks, and finally 
disseminates the blocks to the peers. Since this is a distributed network, the Orderer is usually a third-party 
outside of those that are peers to a particular Channel. 
* There will be a dedicated TLS CA for each Organization (the Orderer and both Peers).
* There will not be any Intermediate CAs. (Although, definitely worth looking into for scalability.)
* Many static credentials were used when registering and enrolling. This may, and honestly should, be changed to 
dynamic via arguments to the script for a real world scenario.
* There are two options for, what's called, the State Database: CouchDB and LevelDB. The State Database is the 
database maintained by each Peer which tracks the current values for all of the assets listed on the ledger. 
LevelDB is the default, and embedded, choice for this decision which will be used by this project.
* The ports to the different services are going to be hard-coded since, honestly, I got tired of re-typing
them in each time. However, a future (post-project) idea would be nice to have them dynamically chosen. They
are as follows:
	- Org0, TLS CA -- main: 7054, operations: 9443
	- Org0, Fab CA -- main: 7055, operations: 9444
	- Org0, orderer0 -- main: 6050, operations: 8443
	- Org1, TLS CA -- main: 7056, operations: 9445
	- Org1, Fab CA -- main: 7057, operations: 9446
	- Org1, peer0 -- main: 6051, chaincode: 6052, operations: 8446
	- Org2, TLS CA -- main: 7058, operations: 9447
	- Org2, Fab CA -- main: 7059, operations: 9448
	- Org2, peer0 -- main: 6053, chaincode: 6054, operations: 8447
	- Org2, peer1 -- main: 6055, chaincode: 6056, operations: 8448

#### Network Topography
![CA Server Diagram](/images/fabric-network-diagram.png)

Above is the general network diagram of my system. As you can see there are three Organizations that
are all separate from one another. The two Peer Organizations will host the Chaincode and the Ledgers
on their Peer nodes. These Peer Nodes are the "entry points" into the network for Clients (the 
End-Users). The Orderer Organization will host the Orderer Node which is where the *ordering* of the
Blocks that go into the Blockchain will take place. All Organization will have their own dedicated TLS
CA Server for secure communications, and their own Fabric CA Server for the necessary Identities on 
the network (to maintain the *permissioned* nature of it). For more information on these conceptual 
ideas such as Orderers, Peers, Identities, Ledgers, etc., I invite you to read the 
`fabsec-report-kretschmar.pdf` document. To see how this diagram looks in directory tree form, as well 
as other structural information of each of the Organizations, please see `fabsec-org-tree.txt`.

### Scripts
The best place to start looking at my project is through the scripts. These scripts are how the network 
gets bootstrapped and realized. Notice that there is no `organizations` directory in the listing above 
although it is mentioned in the `fabsec-org-tree.txt` file. This is because that directory as well as 
all of its children will be instantiated through the first script. As you move through the scripts, more 
and more of the network will come together until, finally, you have a full realized network ready for 
use. The reason for this is I found changes were more easily made through the scripts, and subsequently 
creating and destroy the network, than through made a more "concrete" model.

There are two types of scripts: those that are identified by a number, and those identified by a 
letter. The ones identified by a number are the base scripts. They are the ones that deliver the actual 
commands to the systems, and take in commandline arguments to make them more applicable. The scripts 
identified by a letter are what I'm calling "meta-scripts" which use the base scripts to set up the system 
to the specification of the project. In interest of flow, I'll just talk about the meta-scripts here, but 
you can find out more about all the scripts in the paper and in the comments of the scripts themselves.

The meta-scripts are as follows:

* __000a-create-org-directory-tree-with-symlinks.sh__
	
	This script is what creates the all of the Organizations as they will be used in the network. It 
creates each organization's directory structure, and pre-fills it with various binaries and configuration 
files, where needed. It is also the only meta-script to not use any base scripts.

* __000b-create-orderer-organization.sh__
	
	So, in Fabric, the act of "defining an organization" takes place by registering and enrolling an 
Organizational Administrator. This is done through the Fabric (Identity) Certificate Authority. (More on Fabric 
Identity Certificates in the paper.) To talk to the Fabric CA Server, we need to first set up the TLS CA Server. 
So, that's the flow of this script: Set up -- and bootstrap the admin of -- the TLS CA Server, set up -- and 
bootstrap the admin of -- the Fabric CA Server, and then register and enroll the Organizational Admin themselves.

* __000c-create-peer-organization-1.sh__
	
	This follows the same steps as script 000b, but for Peer Org 1.

* __000d-create-peer-organization-2.sh__
	
	This follows the same steps as script 000b, but for Peer Org 2.

* __000e-create-system-channel-and-deploy-orderer-0.sh__
	
	This script will set up the network and deploy orderer on that network. To start, since Hyperledger 
Fabric is a permissioned blockchain, every node on the network needs to have an identity issued by the Fabric CA 
belonging to their organization. This script starts by doing just that for the orderer node known as orderer0. It 
then creates the Genesis Block for the System Channel. A Channel, in Fabric terms, is essentially an individual 
network within the over-arching network. Since Fabric has the ability to be *multi-tenant*, it allows for many of 
these Channels (or networks) to be set up. There are two types of Channels: the System Channel, and the Application 
Channel. I'll go more into the Application Channel in the next script description. 

	This Channel is the System Channel, otherwise called the "Ordering System Channel". It is used to create 
the way to facilitate communication of the Ordering Service (which is just a fancy term for the group of Orderers 
on the network). In the case of this project, it will only have one Orderer, or an "Ordering Service of one" so to 
speak. The System Channel configuration is stored in a Block on the Blockchain for that Channel. (It is usually one 
Blockchain per Channel for this reason.) In fact, the initial Channel Configuration is always the first (0th) block on 
the chain, and this is what we refer to as the Genesis Block. The process of creating one is outside the scope of this 
README, but it involves a channel configuration YAML file and one of the binaries called `configtxgen`. So, this script 
will use the base script that generates that. It then deploys the Orderer orderer0 which is usually the first node to be 
defined which will consume that block to bootstrap itself.

* __000f-create-fabsec-channel-and-deploy-peer0-org1.sh__
	
	This script will register and enroll the identity for the Peer peer0 in Organization 1. It then creates the 
"Channel Creation Transaction" for my main Application Channel "fabsec-channel". The Channel Creation Transaction is needed 
for the Ordering Service to register and recognize the newly created channel for itself. This is then used for the next base 
script to generate the Genesis Block that defines the configuration of the Application Channel fabsec-channel. As an aside, 
ideally, if we think about expanding this whole "security network" idea to more than just the Log Aggregator, say also use it 
for Access-Control Lists, then that would be in its own Channel. Each Channel has its own Peers, Orderers, Chaincodes, and 
Ledger (among other artifacts). Again, more on Channels in the paper, but I felt it was important enough to spotlight it 
here. So, next this script deploys peer0 and then joins it to the newly instantiated fabsec-channel.

* __000g-deploy-peer0-org2-and-join-fabsec-channel.sh__
	
	This script will register and enroll peer0 of Organization 2, deploy it, and join it to the fabsec-channel. Since 
the System Channel was created and instantiated in script 000e and the Application Channel (fabsec-channel) was created and 
instantiated in the last script (000f), this script doesn't need to do any of that, and simply just joins the existing 
channel. This is illustrative of how easy it is to add nodes once all of heavy lifting has been done.

* __000h-deploy-peer1-org2-and-join-fabsec-channel.sh__
	
	This script will register and enroll peer 1 of Organization 2, deploy it, and join it to the fabsec-channel. Again, 
nothing fancy has to be done here.

* __000i-designate-anchor-peers-for-fabsec.sh__
	
	This meta-script is deceptively simple for its concepts. A lot of the magic is in the base scripts. It involves the 
concepts of Channel Configuration Updating (which is *not* a trivial process using `jq` and the `configtxlator` binary) and 
the Gossip Protocol. Suffice it to say, that this script sets up the Peers used for inter-organizational peer-to-peer communication.

* __000j-deploy-logaggr-chaincode__
	
	This last meta-script is relatively short since it's really just here for general meta-script flow and completeness, 
but it uses the base script 016 to deploy the chaincode to the channel. The process of "deploying" involves installing the chaincode 
to each of the peers, having them approve it for their organization, and committing that chaincode to the channel. After this 
meta-script is done, the FabSec network will have been officially set up. The next part of the project comes in the form of 
javascript modules.

### Javascript
The Javascript is broken up into three parts: the Chaincode, the Backend, and the Frontend. So, let's go over what each one is
and the files within each of these groups:

* The Chaincode

	This is the source code that will get deployed to the Peers. As a reminder, deploying consists of installing, approving,
and committing the chaincode on the peers. To go a bit further, installing happens on all peers of an organization, approving just
need to happen for one peer (since an approval is organization-wide), and committing happens to each Endorsing Peers. (More about
Endorsing Peers in the paper.)

	* index.js

		This is the main file of the chaincode. It works with the `fabric-contract-api` library to interface with the 
peer nodes and, in turn, the Blockchain. For now, there are three functions in here: `initLedger`, `addMessage`, and 
`queryAllMessages`. The `initLedger` isn't currently use but was helpful for production. It could certainly be brought back, if 
needed in the future, to do anything necessary pre-processing. The `addMessage` function is the function that will add a new 
message to the Blockchain. It uses the `stub.putState()` interface function to talk to the blockchain. Last, but not least, is the 
`queryAllMessages` function which, in turn, uses the `stub.getStateByRange()` interface function. As of this writing, and as the 
name of the function implies, it grabs all log entries (or messages) on the Blockchain. However, it could be modified in the future 
to grab user-defined ranges. Another interesting interface function I'd like to play around with is the 
`getStateByPartialCompositeKey()` to provide even more search customization for the user.

	* log-message.js
	
		This is a simple data structure file to help organize our log entries.

* The Backend

	This Backend has three phases it need to go through to have a working system. Enrolling the admin, register and enrolling
the Application User, and finally setting up the environment to watch the logfile for changes and commit them to the Blockchain. We
go over each one now:

	* enroll-admin.js
		
		This module will use the appropriate Organization's Fabric CA Server to 'enroll' the `app-admin`. As a reminder, 
the Fabric CA Server is the one that creates identities for the different participants on the network. This is opposed to the
TLS Server which is what secures communications. An 'enroll' command just produces crypto material for an identity. Typically,
this would be proceeded by a 'register' command (which we'll see in the next module), but in this case, we already have an admin
registered for the Organization, so we'll just use that identity. Of course, in a production environment, you'll probably want
a dedicated app admin. We interface with the Fabric Server through the `FabricCAServices` component of the `fabric-ca-client`
API provided by Hyperledger. After the enrollment, we wrap all the identity information together in a file, and store it in a
special directory called a "Wallet". (A Wallet has its own set of API functions to work with it through the `fabric-network` module.)

	* register-enroll-user.js

		This is similar to the `enroll-admin.js` module, but it is for the `app-user`. Like the `enroll-admin.js` module, it
works through the `FabricCAServices` set of API calls to enroll the app-user's identity. Unlike the previous module, however, it
will also register that identity which creates a whole new identity just for the app-user. This is nice for knowing how our system
is getting used. Other than that, it's pretty much the same. It uses a Wallet object to store the new identity for later use.

	* watch-and-commit-logs.js
	
		This is the main workhorse of the backend. As the name suggests. It holds the functionality to watch the log files
for changes, and then will then commit them to the blockchain. The "watching" part is pretty simple with the built-in `fs.watchFile`
function. The interval is poll for changes is 5 seconds, but generally this will be probably more like a second to a half a second
for a production setting. The real magic is in the suite of functions that the `fabric-network` API provides which includes a function
to access the network through the `Gateway` API. The `Gateway` is controlled through a file known as the Connection Profile. This is
merely a YAML file containing the topography of the network as set up by the operator. With a mode known as Discovery, a lot of how
the Gateway will find nodes in the network is dynamic. However, the Anchor Peers are the main engine for that, and they are statically
defined in the Connection Profile. We use our new created `app-user` identity to identify ourselves to the Gateway, and then select
the Channel we want to connect to via the `getNetwork()` function, and then down to the Smart Contract (aka the Chaincode) we want
to invoke functions from via the `getContract()` function. Finally, we'll commit the new log changes to the Blockchain through the
`submitTranaction()` API function invoking our Chaincode function of `addMessage`. And that's pretty much how this module works.

* The Frontend

	The Frontend is a single module, although it still needs a Wallet and the Connection Profile like the Backend does.

	* index.js

		The main module of the Frontend sets up an Express Server to send the logs to the Browser. In terms of getting those
logs, it needs all the same set up that the Backend does Gateway -> getNetwork -> getContract using the Connection Profile. Once the
set up has been done, it uses the evaluateTransaction from the Contract API to invoke the `queryAllMessages` chaincode function.
